    This repository contains a project that implements a neural network for detecting handwritten digits.

# CNN
The neural network consists of the following layers: 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. This structure allows for the correct detection of handwritten digits.

# Canvas
It also implements the creation of a canvas on which you can draw digits. By clicking the "Save" button, the data from the canvas is sent to the neural network for processing. By clicking "Clear", the current canvas is reset and the user can draw new numbers.

# Results
The detection results are output to the console and also saved to a text file. The canvas itself is saved as a PNG image in a standard size, as well as compressed to the required format (28 x 28 pixels).

# Plans
Next, it is planned to add the ability to select individual digits in the image and determine their meaning.
